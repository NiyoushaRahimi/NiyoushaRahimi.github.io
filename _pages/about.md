I’m a Ph.D. Candidate in Aeronautics and Astronautics engineering at the University of Washington. My research interests includes Vision-based Navigation, Data-Driven Control, Stochastic planning and Multi-agent Systems. I’m also interested in applying the developed techniques to analyze distributed systems operating in cooperative/non-cooperative environments.

I received the B.Sc. degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2016, the M.Sc. degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Washington, in 2018, both in the area of control theory. I’m a recipient of Ruth C. Hertzberg Endowed Fellowship with UW, in 2018.
